## What is this?
JavaScript is a easy to learn and easy to use or at least we can all agree that has a attractive and gradual learning curve.
In fact, anyone can run its first "Hello World!" script in 1 minute just opening the browser's console and typing "console.log('Hello World!')". 

This is one of the (many) reasons why it is one of the most widely used programming language supported by an extremely large community.

Despite those unquestionable greatest attribute, JavaScript has also a bad reputation: I heard it's the "worst language in the world", or "it's totally unreliable" and "it's just  stupid interpreted language used to animate buttons".

I understand where all these concerns are coming from, but I'm truly convinced that JavaScript it's just the world's most misunderstood programming language.

That's why I decide to start collecting all the jokes, the critics and the misconceptions about JavaScript and try to 
demystify most of them.

Feel free to contribute 🙏
